# myfitnesspal-netcarb-extension
How will it work?
It will get fiber data in food items when you are adding food and store it in your local storage. Later when viewing your diary it will create a column to have net carbs i.e., net carbs = carbs - fiber

I wasn't able to find a way to access xhr payload outside of devtool panels in chrome, which doesn't work for the purpose of this project. However, it looks like firefox allows it. So the extension is now officially for Firefox. :)
